    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
         Hi, my name is Ejike Kosisochukwu Jerry, I am a 20-year-old student currently studying in Unizik and Alt School Africa, pursuing a
        Software Engineering program. I have a passion for learning new things and enjoy
        spending my free time playing video games. My favorite color is blue, 
        and I love to eat jollof rice.
        A passionate learner based in Lagos, Nigeria. Where I
        was born and raised. I am excited to continue my studies and I’m deeply curious about how digital products are built—from websites and apps to the logic that powers them. Outside of tech, 
        I enjoy photography and music, which keeps my imagination sharp.
